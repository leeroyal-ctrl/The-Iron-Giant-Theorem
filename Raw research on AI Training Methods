The AI training methodologies I listed are not necessarily used in a progressive or sequential manner for all AI projects. Instead, the choice of methodology often depends on the specific problem, task, or application.

Custom-designed methods for different purposes:

Task-specific methodologies: Different AI tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, or reinforcement learning, often require customized methodologies. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image classification, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used for sequential data like text or time series.
Problem-dependent methodologies: The choice of methodology can depend on the specific problem being addressed. For instance, if the task involves generating new data samples, GANs might be a suitable choice. If the task involves learning from a limited amount of labeled data, semi-supervised learning or transfer learning might be more appropriate.
Data-dependent methodologies: The type and quality of available data can influence the choice of methodology. For example, if the data is unlabeled or partially labeled, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning might be used.
