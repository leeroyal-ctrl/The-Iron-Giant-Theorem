Affective Computing: Complete Overview
Affective Computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human emotions.

DEFINITION & ORIGINS
Coined by: Rosalind Picard (MIT, 1995)
Her foundational book: "Affective Computing" (1997)

Core idea: Computers should be able to:

Recognize human emotions
Express emotions appropriately
Have emotions (or emotion-like states)
Respond to emotions intelligently
Goal: Create more natural, effective human-computer interaction by incorporating emotional intelligence

THE THREE MAIN AREAS:
1. EMOTION RECOGNITION (Input)
How computers detect human emotions

Methods:

Facial Expression Analysis

Computer vision tracking facial movements
Facial Action Coding System (FACS)
Deep learning models (CNNs)
Accuracy: 70-95% depending on conditions
Companies: Affectiva, Kairos, Microsoft Face API
Voice/Speech Analysis

Prosody (pitch, tempo, volume variations)
Voice quality features
Spectral analysis
Cues: Trembling voice = fear, fast/loud = anger
Applications: Call centers, mental health screening
Physiological Signals

Heart rate variability (HRV) - Stress, arousal
Skin conductance (galvanic skin response) - Emotional arousal
EEG (brain activity) - Emotional states
fMRI - Brain regions involved in emotion
Eye tracking - Pupil dilation, gaze patterns
Respiration - Breathing rate and depth
Text/Language Analysis

Sentiment analysis
Emotion detection in written text
Natural language processing (NLP)
Applications: Social media monitoring, customer feedback
Behavioral Patterns

Body posture and movement
Gesture analysis
Typing patterns (keystroke dynamics)
Mouse movement patterns
Multimodal Fusion

Combining multiple signals
Usually more accurate than single modality
Example: Face + voice + text together
2. EMOTION SYNTHESIS (Output)
How computers express emotions

Virtual Agents/Avatars

Body language simulation
Examples: Virtual assistants, game characters
Social Robots

Physical embodiment with emotional displays

Lab-acted vs. natural emotions differ significantly
"In the wild" data harder to label accurately
❌ Privacy & Ethics

Invasive monitoring concerns
Consent issues
Potential for manipulation
Synthesis Challenges:
❌ Uncanny Valley

Almost-but-not-quite-human expressions creepy
