🔥 Cultural Differences in Emotion Perception

How different cultures perceive emotion in same MIDI
GAPS IN RESEARCH (Opportunities):
⚠️ Limited diversity - Most studies use Western classical/pop music
⚠️ Small datasets - Need larger annotated MIDI emotion corpora
⚠️ Context dependency - Same MIDI different contexts = different emotions
⚠️ Individual differences - Personal associations vary widely
⚠️ Temporal dynamics - How emotions evolve during listening

FOR YOUR PAPER:
This could be a fascinating angle! You could explore:

How objective MIDI parameters map to subjective emotional experience
Whether aesthetic criteria should include emotional effectiveness
Cross-cultural differences in emotional response to same MIDI data
Computational vs. human emotion judgment in music

Affective Computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human emotions.

DEFINITION & ORIGINS
Coined by: Rosalind Picard (MIT, 1995)
Her foundational book: "Affective Computing" (1997)

Core idea: Computers should be able to:

Recognize human emotions
Express emotions appropriately
Have emotions (or emotion-like states)
Respond to emotions intelligently
Goal: Create more natural, effective human-computer interaction by incorporating emotional intelligence
