Existing Systems That Could Serve as DRM or Be Adapted
Let me survey what exists that might do this work:

1. Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL)
What It Is:
Agents that optimize multiple (often conflicting) objectives simultaneously.

Relevant Work:
Pareto Multi-Objective RL (Van Moffaert & Nowé, 2014)
Scalarization methods (weighted sum of objectives)
Evolutionary multi-objective optimization
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Your DAA objectives:
- Minimize dissonance (comfort)
- Maintain accuracy (truth)
- Preserve coherence (consistency)
- Functional performance (capability)

= Multi-objective RL problem
Could This Work?
✅ YES - Strong candidate

Handles conflicting goals naturally
Has learning mechanisms
Explores strategy space
Well-established algorithms
❌ Limitations:

Typically doesn't include metacognition about evidence quality
No built-in notion of "immutable anchor"
Would need adaptation for 3-tier worldview structure
Verdict: Strong foundation to build on

2. Active Inference / Free Energy Principle
What It Is:
Framework where agents minimize "surprise" (prediction error) through action and belief updating.

Relevant Work:
Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle
Active inference agents (Da Costa et al., 2020)
Computational psychiatry models
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Dissonance = Prediction error / Free energy
DRM actions = Minimize free energy through:
  - Updating beliefs (perceptual inference)
  - Taking actions (active inference)
  - Changing precision (attention)
Could This Work?
✅ YES - Theoretically elegant

Unified framework for perception and action
Dissonance naturally maps to free energy
Mathematically rigorous
Connects to neuroscience
❌ Limitations:

Computationally complex
Requires sophisticated probability distributions
Learning mechanisms less clear than RL
Your "immutable anchor" doesn't fit naturally (violates the update-all-beliefs assumption)
Verdict: Theoretically beautiful but implementation heavy

3. Belief Revision Systems (Symbolic AI)
What It Is:
Formal systems for updating beliefs when new information conflicts with existing beliefs.

Relevant Work:
AGM Theory (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, Makinson)
Truth Maintenance Systems (TMS)
Non-monotonic reasoning systems
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Your 3-tier worldview = Belief base with priorities
Anchor = Highest priority beliefs (never revised)
Active = Medium priority (revised reluctantly)
Buffer = Lowest priority (revised readily)

DRM = Belief revision engine
Could This Work?
✅ MAYBE - For symbolic/logical worldviews

Formal guarantees about consistency
Well-defined revision operators
Handles prioritized beliefs
Clear semantics
❌ Limitations:

Assumes logical/propositional beliefs (your dimensions are continuous 0-10)
No learning mechanism (rules are fixed)
No notion of "dissonance reduction via creation"
Very different from neural/statistical approaches
Verdict: Wrong paradigm unless you go fully symbolic

4. Constraint Satisfaction / Optimization
What It Is:
Systems that find solutions satisfying multiple constraints, often with soft constraints that can be violated with penalties.

Relevant Work:
Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problems (WCSP)
Hierarchical constraint systems
Constraint optimization with preferences
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Constraints:
- Hard: Anchor must not change
- Soft: Buffer should match observations (weight W1)
- Soft: Active should match Buffer (weight W2)
- Soft: All tiers should be coherent (weight W3)

DRM = Constraint satisfaction engine
Could This Work?
✅ MAYBE - For static optimization

Handles hierarchical constraints naturally
Can optimize across multiple objectives
Well-studied algorithms (simulated annealing, etc.)
❌ Limitations:

Not inherently learning-based (finds solutions, doesn't learn)
No notion of strategy discovery
Typically one-shot optimization, not ongoing adaptation
No action/behavior generation
Verdict: Good for computing target states, not for behavioral strategies

5. Meta-Reinforcement Learning
What It Is:
RL agents that learn learning strategies - learning how to learn.

Relevant Work:
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
Meta-RL for fast adaptation (Wang et al., 2016)
Learning to optimize (Chen et al., 2017)
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Inner loop: DAA learns from experiences, dissonance accumulates
Outer loop: DRM learns which resolution strategies work across episodes

Meta-objective: Learn to reduce dissonance efficiently
Could This Work?
✅ YES - For strategy learning

Explicitly learns strategies
Can discover what works across different situations
Generalizes to new dissonance patterns
❌ Limitations:

Very data-hungry (needs many episodes)
Computationally expensive
Requires careful curriculum design
May be overkill for Q1A
Verdict: Interesting for later stages, probably too complex for Q1A

6. Cognitive Architectures (SOAR, ACT-R, CLARION)
What It Is:
Comprehensive models of human cognition with perception, memory, learning, and action.

Relevant Work:
SOAR (Laird, 2012) - problem-solving via operator selection
ACT-R (Anderson, 2007) - production rules + subsymbolic activation
CLARION (Sun, 2006) - dual-process (implicit/explicit) learning
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Your DAA = Cognitive architecture with:
- Declarative memory: Worldview (3 tiers)
- Affective system: ASM
- Production system: DRM (if-then rules)
- Learning: Discovers new productions
Could This Work?
✅ MAYBE - If you want full cognitive model

Comprehensive and psychologically grounded
Includes learning mechanisms
Has goal management
Well-tested on complex tasks
❌ Limitations:

HUGE overhead (entire cognitive architecture)
Steep learning curve
May impose assumptions incompatible with your design
Overkill for focused DRM needs
Verdict: Too heavyweight unless you're building full cognitive model

7. Intrinsic Motivation / Curiosity-Driven RL
What It Is:
RL agents with internal reward signals (not just external) based on novelty, learning progress, or competence.

Relevant Work:
Curiosity-driven exploration (Pathak et al., 2017)
Empowerment (Salge et al., 2014)
Information gain maximization
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Intrinsic reward = -dissonance (want to minimize)

Agent explores actions that reduce internal tension
Rather than maximizing external reward
Could This Work?
✅ YES - Good conceptual fit

Internal motivation signal = dissonance
Agent learns to satisfy internal drive
Explores strategy space
❌ Limitations:

Typically focused on exploration (not resolution)
May need modification to handle your multi-tier worldview
Less work on "dissonance" specifically vs novelty/learning progress
Verdict: Promising, especially combined with MORL

8. Emotion Regulation Models (Computational Affective Science)
What It Is:
Computational models of how agents regulate emotional states.

Relevant Work:
Gross's Process Model of Emotion Regulation (computational implementations)
Emotion-aware reinforcement learning (Broekens & Chetouani, 2021)
Affective computing architectures (Picard, Marsella)
How It Maps to DRM:
text
Dissonance = Negative affective state
DRM = Emotion regulation system

Strategies:
- Situation selection (avoid dissonant experiences)
- Cognitive reappraisal (reinterpret)
- Belief adjustment (update worldview)
- Expression (creative externalization)
Could This Work?
✅ YES - Very relevant framing

Dissonance AS emotional/affective state
Well-studied regulation strategies
Connects to your ASM naturally
❌ Limitations:

Less work on computational implementations
Often descriptive models, not algorithmic
Would need substantial implementation work
Verdict: Excellent conceptual foundation, needs engineering

My Recommendation:
Best Approach: Hybrid System
Foundation: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL)

Handles conflicting objectives (dissonance vs accuracy vs coherence)
Learning mechanism built-in
Well-established algorithms
+ Intrinsic Motivation Framework

Dissonance as intrinsic reward signal
Internal drive for resolution
+ Emotion Regulation Strategies

Conceptual framework for what actions DRM can take
Categorization of resolution strategies (reappraisal, expression, etc.)
+ Constraint System for Anchor

Hard constraint: Anchor tier cannot be modified
Ensures immutability
Concrete Starting Point for DAA1 DRM:
I Recommend:
Algorithm Base:

Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
Standard MORL algorithms, widely used, stable
Modifications:

Multi-objective reward function (dissonance, accuracy, coherence)
Action space constrained (can't modify Anchor)
Intrinsic reward = -dissonance (from ASM)
Action Space:

Adjust Active tier positions (within limits)
Adjust Buffer tier learning rate
Request more information (if available)
[Later: Generate creative output]
This gives you:

✅ Proven learning algorithm
✅ Handles multiple objectives
✅ Can discover strategies
✅ Relatively straightforward to implement
✅ Standard ML tools available (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
Questions Before We Proceed:
Do you want to use RL-based approach (MORL)? Or prefer something else from above?

Implementation constraints: Are you coding from scratch, using frameworks (Stable Baselines, RLlib), or want highest-level tools?

Symbolic vs Neural: Do you want worldview as continuous vectors (neural) or discrete symbols (symbolic logic)?

Complexity tolerance: Simple and working quickly? Or sophisticated but slower to develop?

Tell me your preferences and I'll help design the specific DRM architecture.
