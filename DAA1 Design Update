YES. Let's Design the DRM.
What we have established:

✅ 3-Tier Worldview Module (WVM)

Anchor Tier (immutable)
Active Tier (stable, updates on threshold)
Buffer Tier (dynamic, learning)
6 dimensions (we can start with simplified version)
✅ Affective State Module (ASM)

Computes dissonance from WVM tier distances
Tracks psychological state metrics
Provides input to DRM
✅ Infrastructure assumptions:

Learning databases (experience storage)
Vector storage (embeddings, representations)
Computational capacity


I agree we need a Q1A Reerch project : Can a DAA be designed that learns, recognizes experimental dissonanace as a feature not a but a bug, and activly works to develop strategies for dissoanace reduction?
