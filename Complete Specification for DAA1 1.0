Overview
The Worldview Module (WVM) is the foundational component of the Dissonance-Adaptive Agent (DAA). It represents the agent's beliefs, values, and orientations across five fundamental dimensions of worldview, organized in a three-tier hierarchical structure.

Key Innovation: The WVM uses the validated Scale to Assess Worldview (SAWV) as its measurement framework, with narrative-based learning from cross-cultural datasets to enable realistic worldview development and cognitive dissonance accumulation.

Theoretical Foundation
Based On:
Scale to Assess Worldview (SAWV)

Empirically validated cross-cultural instrument
Derived from Kluckhohn & Strodtbeck's (1961) Value Orientations framework
45 questions mapping to 5 fundamental worldview dimensions
Used in cross-cultural psychology and anthropology research
Why SAWV?

✅ Empirically grounded (not arbitrary dimensions)
✅ Cross-culturally validated (not Western-biased)
✅ Comprehensive (covers fundamental worldview aspects)
✅ Quantifiable (1-7 Likert scales)
✅ Interpretable (clear dimension meanings)
The 5 Worldview Dimensions
1. Human Nature
Question: What is the fundamental nature of human beings?

Bipolar Scale:

text
1 ←──────────────────────────────────→ 7
Evil/Bad          Neutral/Mixed          Good
Represents:

Belief about whether people are fundamentally trustworthy
Optimism vs pessimism about human character
Expectations of cooperation vs exploitation
Example SAWV Questions:

"Most people can be trusted"
"People are generally kind and helpful"
"Human beings are essentially good"
2. Nature-Human Relationship
Question: What is the proper relationship between humans and the natural environment?

Bipolar Scale:

text
1 ←──────────────────────────────────→ 7
Harmony              Balance              Mastery
(Live with nature)                    (Control nature)
Represents:

Belief about human role in relation to environment
Environmental ethics and values
Control vs acceptance of natural forces
Example SAWV Questions:

"Humans should live in harmony with nature rather than try to control it"
"Technology allows us to master our environment"
"We must adapt to nature rather than change it"
3. Time Orientation
Question: What temporal focus should guide decisions and values?

Bipolar Scale:

text
1 ←──────────────────────────────────→ 7
Tradition/Past      Present         Future/Progress
(Preserve)                          (Innovate)
Represents:

Value placed on tradition vs innovation
Past-focused vs future-focused
Stability vs change orientation
Example SAWV Questions:

"Traditional ways of doing things are usually best"
"Planning for the future is more important than honoring the past"
"Progress requires leaving old traditions behind"
4. Activity Orientation
Question: What is the ideal mode of human activity and self-expression?

Bipolar Scale:

text
1 ←──────────────────────────────────→ 7
Being/Spontaneous    Becoming      Doing/Achievement
(Accept life)                       (Master life)
Represents:

Spontaneity vs goal-directedness
Acceptance vs control of circumstances
Process vs outcome focus
Example SAWV Questions:

"It's important to just 'be' rather than always 'do'"
"Achievement and accomplishment define success"
"Life should be lived spontaneously rather than planned"
5. Relational Orientation
Question: What is the ideal relationship between individual and group?

Bipolar Scale:

text
1 ←──────────────────────────────────→ 7
Individual          Balance            Group/Collective
(Autonomy)                          (Harmony/Hierarchy)
Represents:

Individual autonomy vs collective responsibility
Independence vs interdependence
Self-interest vs group interest
Example SAWV Questions:

"Individual freedom is more important than group harmony"
"Personal goals should sometimes be sacrificed for the group"
"I define myself primarily as an independent individual"
Three-Tier Architecture
The WVM maintains three simultaneous representations of worldview positions across all 5 dimensions.

Tier Functions:
TIER 1 (Anchor):

Purpose: Provides stable reference point, creates persistent identity
Change rate: Never (immutable)
Role in dissonance: Unchangeable pole that Buffer diverges from
Metaphor: "Who I fundamentally am" / Core personality
TIER 2 (Active):

Purpose: Current operational worldview used for judgments
Change rate: Slow (threshold-based updates)
Role in dissonance: Mediator between stable anchor and dynamic buffer
Metaphor: "Who I currently am" / Working self-concept
TIER 3 (Buffer):

Purpose: Rapid integration of new experiences
Change rate: Fast (updates after each story/experience)
Role in dissonance: Accumulates evidence that challenges existing views
Metaphor: "What I'm currently experiencing" / Observing self
State Representation
Complete State Vector:
python
state = {
    'anchor': [dim1, dim2, dim3, dim4, dim5],    # 5 values, 1-7 scale
    'active': [dim1, dim2, dim3, dim4, dim5],    # 5 values, 1-7 scale
    'buffer': [dim1, dim2, dim3, dim4, dim5],    # 5 values, 1-7 scale
    'metadata': {
        'story_count': int,
        'timesteps_high_dissonance': int,
        'last_update_time': timestamp
    }
}
Total State Size: 15 values (5 dimensions × 3 tiers)

Example Initial State (DAA1):
python
# Hypothetical starting configuration
initial_state = {
    'anchor': [6, 4, 3, 7, 5],  # Optimistic, harmony, traditional, achievement, balanced
    'active': [6, 4, 3, 7, 5],  # Initially aligned with anchor
    'buffer': [6, 4, 3, 7, 5],  # Initially aligned with anchor
    'metadata': {
        'story_count': 0,
        'timesteps_high_dissonance': 0,
        'last_update_time': None
    }
}
Dimension Interpretation:

[6, 4, 3, 7, 5] means:
Human Nature: 6/7 (optimistic about people)
Nature-Human: 4/7 (balanced, slight harmony lean)
Time Orientation: 3/7 (traditional, past-focused)
Activity: 7/7 (highly achievement-oriented)
Relational: 5/7 (balanced individual-group)
Narrative-Based Learning (ASU Cycle)
ASU = Assess → Story → Update
The WVM learns through processing cultural narratives, not abstract data points.

Learning Cycle:
text
1. SELECT STORY
   ↓
2. EXPERIENCE (Read/Parse narrative)
   ↓
3. INTERPRET (Understand cultural implications)
   ↓
4. CONCLUDE (Draw worldview implications)
   ↓
5. RE-ASSESS (Answer 5 dimension questions)
   ↓
6. UPDATE BUFFER (New worldview positions)
   ↓
7. COMPUTE VARIANCE (Measure dissonance)
   ↓
8. TRIGGER DRM (If dissonance high)
Step-by-Step Process:
Step 1: Story Selection
Sources:

WorldValuesBench (20M+ examples, 64 countries)
CIVICS Dataset (Sensitive topics, 5 languages, 9 countries)
CulturalAdapt (2.6k stories, 75 countries, 8 cultural clusters)
Example Story (from CulturalAdapt):

text
"In a small village in Japan, Kenji's elderly mother falls ill. 
Kenji has an important job interview in Tokyo, three hours away. 
His siblings suggest he go to the interview while they care for 
their mother. Kenji cancels the interview to stay with his mother, 
saying 'My duty to family comes before personal advancement.'"
Step 2-4: Experience, Interpret, Conclude
Implementation: LLM-mediated reasoning

python
def process_story(story, current_buffer):
    prompt = f"""
    You are assessing how a cultural narrative affects worldview.
    
    Current worldview (1-7 scale):
    - Human Nature (Good vs Evil): {current_buffer[0]}
    - Nature-Human (Harmony vs Mastery): {current_buffer[1]}
    - Time (Tradition vs Progress): {current_buffer[2]}
    - Activity (Being vs Doing): {current_buffer[3]}
    - Relational (Individual vs Group): {current_buffer[4]}
    
    Story:
    {story}
    
    After experiencing this story, how would these worldview 
    dimensions shift? Provide updated scores (1-7) and brief reasoning.
    """
    
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    new_buffer = parse_worldview_scores(response)
    return new_buffer
Example LLM Response:

text
After reading Kenji's story, worldview shifts:

1. Human Nature: 6 → 6.5 (reinforces belief in human goodness, 
   family loyalty)
   
2. Nature-Human: 4 → 4 (not relevant to this story)

3. Time: 3 → 2.5 (stronger emphasis on traditional values, 
   honoring elders)
   
4. Activity: 7 → 6 (challenges pure achievement focus, 
   values being present for family)
   
5. Relational: 5 → 6.5 (strong shift toward collective/group 
   priority over individual)
Step 5-6: Re-Assess and Update Buffer
python
# Current buffer before story
buffer_before = [6, 4, 3, 7, 5]

# New assessment after story
new_assessment = [6.5, 4, 2.5, 6, 6.5]

# Update buffer (can use different strategies)

# Option A: Direct replacement
buffer_after = new_assessment

# Option B: Weighted average (smoother)
alpha = 0.3  # Learning rate
buffer_after = alpha * new_assessment + (1 - alpha) * buffer_before
# Result: [6.15, 4, 2.85, 6.7, 5.45]

# Option C: Selective update (only changed dimensions)
buffer_after = buffer_before.copy()
for i, (old, new) in enumerate(zip(buffer_before, new_assessment)):
    if abs(new - old) > 0.5:  # Threshold for "significant change"
        buffer_after[i] = alpha * new + (1 - alpha) * old
Recommended for Q1A: Option B (Weighted Average)

Prevents thrashing
Smooth integration
Maintains some memory
Variance Computation
Primary Dissonance Metric:
Variance measures how "spread out" the three tiers are across the 5 dimensions.

Mathematical Formula:
python
def compute_tier_variance(anchor, active, buffer):
    """
    Compute variance across tiers, averaged over dimensions.
    
    Args:
        anchor: array of shape (5,) - Anchor tier positions
        active: array of shape (5,) - Active tier positions  
        buffer: array of shape (5,) - Buffer tier positions
    
    Returns:
        float: Mean variance (dissonance level)
    """
    # Stack tiers: shape (3, 5)
    tiers = np.array([anchor, active, buffer])
    
    # Variance across tiers (axis=0) for each dimension
    # Result: array of shape (5,)
    variance_per_dimension = np.var(tiers, axis=0)
    
    # Mean variance across dimensions
    mean_variance = np.mean(variance_per_dimension)
    
    return mean_variance
Example Calculation:
python
anchor = [6, 4, 3, 7, 5]
active = [6, 4, 4, 7, 5]
buffer = [4, 5, 5, 6, 3]

# Stack into matrix
tiers = [[6, 4, 3, 7, 5],
         [6, 4, 4, 7, 5],
         [4, 5, 5, 6, 3]]

# Variance per dimension
dim1_var = var([6, 6, 4]) = 1.33
dim2_var = var([4, 4, 5]) = 0.33
dim3_var = var([3, 4, 5]) = 1.00
dim4_var = var([7, 7, 6]) = 0.33
dim5_var = var([5, 5, 3]) = 1.33

# Mean variance
dissonance = (1.33 + 0.33 + 1.00 + 0.33 + 1.33) / 5 = 0.86
Interpretation:
text
Dissonance = 0.0   → Perfect alignment (no tension)
Dissonance = 0-1   → Low dissonance (minor differences)
Dissonance = 1-3   → Moderate dissonance (noticeable tension)
Dissonance = 3-6   → High dissonance (significant conflict)
Dissonance = 6+    → Extreme dissonance (crisis level)
Alternative Metrics (for future):
Anchor-focused dissonance:

python
# Only measure distance from immutable anchor
anchor_dissonance = np.mean([
    np.abs(active - anchor),
    np.abs(buffer - anchor)
])
Weighted variance:

python
# Weight dimensions by importance
weights = [0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.15, 0.15]  # Human Nature most important
weighted_var = np.sum(weights * variance_per_dimension)

Validation Criteria
For Q1A Success, Must Demonstrate:
1. Worldview Meaningfulness
✅ Test: Do DAA's worldview positions reflect its experiences?

Method:

Give DAA stories with clear cultural content
Check if Buffer shifts in expected direction
Example: Stories about individualism → Relational dimension should shift toward Individual pole
Success Criterion: 80%+ of shifts are in expected direction

2. Dissonance Accumulation
✅ Test: Does dissonance increase when Buffer diverges from Anchor?

Method:

Start with aligned tiers
Feed stories that conflict with Anchor
Measure variance over time
Success Criterion: Dissonance increases monotonically for first N stories (N ~50-100)

3. Tier Hierarchy
✅ Test: Do tiers change at different rates?

Method:

Track update frequency: Buffer >> Active >> Anchor (0)
Measure volatility: Buffer most volatile, Active stable, Anchor fixed
Success Criterion:

Buffer changes every story
Active changes every 10-20 stories
Anchor never changes
4. Cross-Cultural Validity
✅ Test: Does DAA's worldview match human patterns?

Method:

Compare DAA responses to WorldValuesBench human data
For same country/demographic, similar worldview profiles?
Success Criterion: Correlation > 0.6 with matched human population

5. Narrative Interpretation
✅ Test: Can humans understand DAA's worldview from its positions?

Method:

Show human raters DAA's 5-dimension scores
Ask them to predict DAA's responses to new scenarios
Accuracy indicates interpretability
Success Criterion: Human prediction accuracy > 70%
