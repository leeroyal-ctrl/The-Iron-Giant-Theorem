Revised Q1A Objective
Q1A: Can we design a Dissonance-Adaptive Agent (DAA) that:
Learns from experience (updates internal states based on new information)

Recognizes cognitive dissonance as a functional signal (not system failure, but meaningful information about internal conflicts)

Actively develops strategies for dissonance reduction (autonomously discovers and refines approaches to restore equilibrium)

Success Criteria for Q1A:
The DAA must demonstrably:
✅ Experience measurable dissonance

ASM metrics show increasing tension when Buffer tier diverges from Anchor
✅ Treat dissonance as signal, not noise

DRM activates in response to dissonance (doesn't ignore or malfunction)
System remains operational under dissonance (doesn't crash/freeze)
✅ Generate resolution strategies

DRM attempts multiple approaches (not just one hardcoded response)
Strategies actually target dissonance reduction (not random behavior)
✅ Learn which strategies work

DRM preferentially selects strategies that successfully reduce dissonance
Shows improvement over time (later attempts more effective than early ones)
✅ Maintain functional operation throughout

Continues learning during dissonance states
Preserves Anchor integrity (doesn't delete or corrupt it)
Remains coherent and interpretable
Key Insight in Your Framing:
"Dissonance as Feature, Not Bug"
This reframes the entire architecture:

Traditional AI view:

Conflicting objectives = problem to eliminate through better design
Internal inconsistency = error state
Solution: Remove conflicts
Your DAA view:

Cognitive dissonance = valuable information signal
Internal tension = motivation for adaptive behavior
Solution: Design agent that USES dissonance productively
This is the core innovation.

The DAA doesn't just tolerate dissonance - it recognizes it as the driver for adaptive creativity.
