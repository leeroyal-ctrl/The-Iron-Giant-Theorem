The Iron Giant Theorem - That artificial intelligence and its associated technologies are built by humans, and since humans can have either evil or benevolent intent, so can AI. The Iron Giant Theorem intends to be an idea and project nursery where we plants seeds that might one day grow into Tools, Methods and protocols That can defend humans against accidental or deliberate Artificial Intelligence evil.

Comparison: DARA vs. Anthropic’s "Constitutional AI" (CAI)
In the context of defending against AI evil, these two approaches are "seeds" planted in the same garden, but they grow in different directions.

Compare: Both utilize a "Core Value" system to govern AI behavior. Anthropic’s CAI uses a "Constitution" (a set of written principles), which functions similarly to DARA’s Anchor Tier. Both systems aim to ensure that the AI's "intent" remains aligned with human safety, even when processing complex or potentially harmful data.

Contrast: Constitutional AI is a Construction Tool; it is used during training to "bake" safety into the model through reinforcement learning. DARA is a Diagnostic & Defensive Tool. While CAI forces a model to be good, DARA is a "nursery" for measuring the corruption process. DARA discovers the "breaking point" where an agent’s baseline (benevolence) fails under the pressure of "evil" narratives. DARA’s three-tiered architecture allows us to see the infection of an idea in the Buffer Tier before it reaches the Anchor. While CAI provides the "armor" (the constitution), DARA provides the "Immune System Monitoring Protocol"—discovering how intent evolves and providing a method to defend against its degradation.
