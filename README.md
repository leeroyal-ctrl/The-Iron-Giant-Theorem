# The-Iron-Giant-Theorem 
Creativity can emerge from individually trained artificial inteligence agents

Named after the central theme of the 1999 film The Iron Giant. The Giant, a machine built for destruction, transcends its programming through experience and relationship, ultimately choosing its own identity.
It is the principle behind developing a set of tools, Algorithms, methods and processes to test a theory of emergent creatvity by artifical inteligence

"Train up a AI Agent in the way it should go; even when it is old it will not depart from it" - Adapted from Proverbs 22:7
