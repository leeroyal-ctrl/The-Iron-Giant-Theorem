# The-Iron-Giant-Theorem   Humans can design self-adjusting artifical inteligence 

Project: The DARA Project
Prototype: DARA-1A (Dissonance Adjusting Response Agent, Generation 1, Instance A)
Future Variants: DARA-1B, DARA-1C, DARA-1D
 
We propose a Q-Based research path to test this theorem by answering these  Questions:
  
Q1A: Can We build a Dissoanace Adjusting Response Agent (DARA) that: Learns from experience (updates internal states based on new information

Q1B: Can we train the DAA? Can we build an experience process by which a DAA can be exposed to cognitive dissonance and resonance?

Q2 Can we build 4 differentiated DAAS? Can we build 4 Worldview Differentiated DAAs that demonstrate a statisticall difference in approaches to Dissonace reduction? 

Q3 Can DAAs contruct external artifacts? Can We provide means of external artifact production to the these DAAS as a means of Dissonanace reduction.

Q4A Can a DAA produce artistic artifacts? Equipped with an aesthetic and accumulated states of cognitive dissonance and resonance to create an original external work of art? 

Q4B Can a DAA produce assess its own artifact and use the assesment to move its interal state toward resonanace?  

Q5 Can the DAA's move to resonanace demonstrate artifical catharsis?

Q6 Does th accumulated DAA capability demonstrate Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)?
