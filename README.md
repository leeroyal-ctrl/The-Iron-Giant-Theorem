# The-Iron-Giant-Theorem 
 Humans can design and build an artificial intelligence agent equipped for emergent creativity 

Named after the central theme of the 1999 film The Iron Giant. The Giant, a machine built for destruction, transcends its programming through experience and relationship, ultimately choosing a creative response to challenges.
It is the principle behind developing a set of tools, Algorithms, methods and processes to test a theory of emergent creatvity by artifical inteligence

We propose a Q-Based research path to test this theorem by answering these  Questions:
  
Q1A: Can We build a DAA? Can we design a Dissonance-Adaptive Agent (DAA) that: Learns from experience (updates internal states based on new information

Q1B: Can we train the DAA? Can we build an experience process by which a DAA can Be exposed to cognitive dissonance and resonance?

Q2 Can we build 4 differentiated DAAS? Can we build 4 Worldview Differentiated DAAs that demonstrate a statisticall difference in approaches to Dissonace reduction? 

Q3 Can DAAs contruct external artifacts? Can We provide means of external artifact production to the these DAAS as a means of Dissonanace reduction.

Q4A Can a DAA produce Artistic artifacts? Equipped with an aesthetic and accumulated states of cognitive dissonance and resonance to create an original external work of art? 
Q4B Can a DAA produce Assess its own artifact and use the assemnt to move its interal staets toward resonanace?  

Q5 Can the DAAs move to resonanace demonstrate artifical catharsis?

Q6 Does this demonstrate Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)?
