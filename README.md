# The-Iron-Giant-Theorem 
 Humans can design and build an artificial intelligence agent equipped for emergent creativity 

Named after the central theme of the 1999 film The Iron Giant. The Giant, a machine built for destruction, transcends its programming through experience and relationship, ultimately choosing a creative response to challenges.
It is the principle behind developing a set of tools, Algorithms, methods and processes to test a theory of emergent creatvity by artifical inteligence

We propose a Q-Based research path to test this theorem by answering these 6 Questions:
  
Q1 Can we build a Differentiated Artificial Intelligence Agent capable of cognitive dissonance and resonance?

Q2 Can we build an experience process by which such an Agent can Be exposed to cognitive dissonance and resonance?

Q3 Can We transfer an aesthetic into this equipped Agent?

Q4 Can this equipped agent with an aesthetic tool set use accumulated states of cognitive dissonance and resonance to create an original external work of art? 

Q5 Can the Agent's art process be shown as a catharsis that reestablishes equilibrium in its internal state?

Q6 Is this Emergent Artificial Intelligence Creativity?

"Train up a AI Agent in the way it should go; even when it is old it will not depart from it" - Adapted from Proverbs 22:7
